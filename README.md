WWDC 2023 Swift Student Challenge (Winner)

# About this Project
For this year Swift Student Challenge I wanted to create something that helps students around the world with their Mental Wellbeing. I collected the most popular tools to improve certain areas of the mental wellbeing of students. I used SwiftUI for the most part. I also included PencilKit for the Journal Feature so that you not only can type but actually write like your iPad would be a piece of paper. I also included a Mood Tracker, a Motivation Board (which in my option is great to look at it if you are feeling down) and a Gratitude Feature where you can write 3 things to be grateful for. I also provided Helpful Resources such as Mental Health America or the Crisis Text Line to help to support the people in need. I know that not everyone on this planet is fortunate enough to  have access to professionals, so I hope I can help them to make their life better, because Mental Health is one of the biggest challenge that we face as humanity, so it's a good beginning to start with the future of humanity: the students.
